# KI-AI
The all in one AI tool. It is my first GitHub project. Very Basic and currently only contains pre-programmed functions, but is still useful to have. 

Welcome to my Read Me file. 
This should highlight the next couple of steps I will take on my repository.
I will put a Star next to completed Tasks.

V1
1. First, I will add some conversation buttons just to get the very basic aspects of the software completed.
2. Now I will add some background colours and maybe some padding if want to before I push on to V2.

V2
1. Figure out how to intergrate Open AI into my projects.
2. Add OPEN AI to the Search function to be able to legitmately claim the project contains AI...
3. Add an OPEN AI chat function, but keep the button functions as I have value in those.

That's all I could think of for now.
